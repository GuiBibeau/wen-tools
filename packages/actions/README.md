# Wen Actions

**Wen Tools are under heavy development**

Straight forward, batteries includes utilities to build dapps.

_For turnkey connect component see: [Wen React](/packages/@wen/react)_

## Getting started

Wen Actions depends on no other libraries to get started. It can completely be used as a standalone library but it works well with ethers.jsx

```sh
npm i @wen/actions
# or
yarn add @wen/actions
# or
pnpm i @wen/actions
```

## Interacting with a user's wallet

All functions are asynchronous.

```jsx
import { connectWallet, changeChain } from "@wen/actions";

// request a connection
connectWallet();
// request the user to change to ethereum
changeChain("0x1");
```

## Reading data from the user's wallet

Wen Actions support both vanilla js and react.

### JS/TS

A readonly proxy object is exposed to work.

```ts
import { state } from "@wen/actions";

// state is an instance of State
type State = {
  metamaskPresent: Promise<boolean>;
  address: string | null;
  balance: string | null;
  connected: boolean;
  chainId: string | null;
  // anytime the state is waiting on an updte from metamask, requesting is true
  requesting: boolean;
};
```

### React

For reactive updates use the React hook. It exposes the same state as the vanilla js/ts proxy object.

```tsx
import { useWen } from "@wen/react";

export default function Home() {
  // anytime the state is waiting on an updte from metamask, requesting is true
  const { address, balance, connected, chainId, requesting } = useWen();
  return <div>{address}</div>;
}
```
